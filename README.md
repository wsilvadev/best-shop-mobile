## what this app is

_This is a shopping app, created to improve knowledge and is not published on any platform, it is a test app.
Its objective is to search for some data from the API (this API is being fetched from a back-end created in another repository) showing each item on its tab, if clicking on any item will open a details screen where the user will decide whether to add to the cart or not, if you add it you will be directed to another tab, showing how many and which items have been added..._
